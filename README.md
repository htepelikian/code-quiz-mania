# code-quiz-mania

Greetings!
This project is meant to display all the functions of HTML, CSS, and JS tied together. Here we have a quiz consisting of 4 questions. The quiz consists of a highscore list and a timer. When the user presses the button to begin the quiz, the timer starts running. When the user answers a question, they are immediately presented with the next question soon after. If the user answers a question wrong, they are deducted by 10 seconds, and if they answer a question right they receive 25 points! The user is able to save their highscore to the list at the very end, by entering their initials. Ready, set, go!
